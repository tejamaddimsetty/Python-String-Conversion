# Python-String-Manipulation-Example
Concepts involved are : `Consonants`, `Vowels`, `Functions in Python`, `Lists in Python`
## Problem Statement:
Write a Python program to traverse a string to an consonant or an ovel by following the below instructions.
* You need to start traversing from index k till end of string and then you can traverse back from end to beginning.
* At index k you need to check if the character is vowel or consonant.
* If it vowel you need to convert it into any consonant and vice versa and according you need to convert entire string into one kind of characters i.e vowels or consonants.
* Now the cost of moving from one index to next index is 1 coin and cost of converting a character into another character is also 1 coin.
* Output should be total cost to get desired output string.

### Sample Input Information
Sample Input: `aeioaaeiou`.

#### Warning!
I picked another Input `VIJAYAWADA`. But process never stops because this string has Consonant, Vowel and so on. Now the program runs life time or may be breaks at a point `2^n` with an error.\
So if you want to look out possible output please enter the Sample Input Information.
